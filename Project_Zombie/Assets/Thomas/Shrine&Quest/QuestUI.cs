//how to get the quests? because certain quests should not work.



//IDEAS FOR QUESTS
//Kill x enemies.
//kill x bosses.
//find x ability boxes.
//find x resource boxes
//open all doors in the stage.
//break x tokens - tokens appear in the map and you never to hover over them to break them
//break x statues - statues appear and they need to be shot at to destroy.
//survive till turn x


//for now all quests will be about slaying enemies or about finding ability boxes
//i will create colors for them -

//1 - Curse - Red
//2 - {} - blue
//3 - challenge - yellow (should shine)


//so there are three types of shrine
//1 - you click and you instantly get the task. it has no timer. but if you end the mission without completing it you get penalized.
//2 - you click and you open the screen with three different quests. it has timer. you get penalized for no completing in time.
//3 - you click and you get one task. you can either accept or not. it has no timer. it is the hardest but it gives unique stuff.

//

//quests that are from the base will achieve things only in teh base.


//what about space for ui?
//we could only show it when its required.
//for now it will stay in the left.
//there should be a differentation for the main goal and secondary.
