//MY NOTATIONS 2 - DESIGN
//what can i learn from biding of isaac?
//each map should have its secrets.

//special enemies will spawn. once damaged they will flee and despawn in a short moment. killing them grant something. 
//there are boxes that grant something random for the run. like higher luck
//certain itens or quests can only be completed in certain round types, and those round types can be triggered in some way.

//possible secrets
//hitting some things that are hidden.
//there are vases that can be destroyed
//you can get random stuff as reward from the shrines.
//i want it to be faster. certain shrines just give stuff.
//there are certain terrain quests. like a place that you have to hold your ground, kill enemies in area. run around the map
//there should be a bit of plataformer?


//STORY CHARS:
//Stich: one handed doctor. gives you healing passives and trinkets

//effects for teh teleporter, something cool
///when you reload the stage it is showing the weapon you had. the tempo weapon.
//not everywhere you should be able to fall
///improve the aim. its no accurate enough. mostly the grpahical stuff, should show how unprecise the aim is.
///nerf the quantity of mage attacks. nerf the health.


//what would make a teleporter cool?
///start rotating the teleporter and stop after the player leaves
//a sound start getting stronger
//if you are stunned during the teleport it should stop the teleporter.
//after 40% is charged then movement is locked. 
//shock start appearing from the machine
//the screen fades to blue, but it needs a cool whirl effect.

//if there is a wayout it will use it instead of teh telerpoter. always
//but it always inform the other teleporter that it can be used.
//if either of them has cooldown, the cooldown is activated.
//if you use a teleporter that does not have timer, nothing happens
//if you go to a teleporter that has tiomer, it starts the timer
//if you use a teleporter that has timer, it spots the timer.


//it starts with the sound, when the sounds starts getting really loud, the player gets locked
//smoke starts playing in the middle of teh sound
//once the player is locked, a blue effect triggers on his feet.
//the screen starts becoming black, mid screen transition the player is made invisible and thunder appears
//after transition we go to the next thing


//GOAL
//place the 3dmodels. enemy.
//3d models can use the gun_Perma, the hands will move to 
//animation for walking, dying, swapping guns, abilities.
//the player should be aiming at roughly the center and never shooting at further than the aim
//




//create animation
//walking
//walking back
//the player can hold different weapons
//reloading different weapons
//when the player gets hit
//when the player dies
//when the player falls
//when the player dashss
//when teh player interact with somethiung, and is doing nothing else
//then we start creating animations for the enemies.
//also animation for shooting. as it creats a backfire.


//now lets figure how to hold the weapon, and then the play animation right for holdign teh weapon
//then we are going overhaull the swap weapon system so that we can use animation
//then we need to check being hit and its animation
//reload animation
//then we are going to do dash
//then death
//then we are going to head to the player system


//it looks weird because of the animation.
//how to improve the animation?
//the gun_Perma is too big
//

//then the next step will be creating the enemy prefabs and animations
//certain non-especial enemies have a pool of prefabs they can spawn.
//i want a difference between running, and walking

//the only thing i will do for now is change teh speed.
//there is a cap to speed, a min and a max, and i will use to determine a value between 1 and 4


///now i will do the equip stuff.
///there will be stpo for each weapon.
///now there is a timer for swapping guns. it can be stopped by the same thing as reload
//then we will create a reload animation.
//then player getting hit
//animation i will do later 

//now i need to createa  system taht works like this
//you can use E and Q for swapping guns. 
//any temp gun_Perma chosen the perma gun_Perma will take its place.
//we will also overhaull the the ui for gun_Perma ui

//GOAL PATH
///need to fix the reload.
//need to test for getting a chest gun
//need to test for getting the upgraded

//GOAL ANIMATION
//create dash animation
//


//enemy has animations
//if the player has not being spotted
//WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
//there is a problem where enemy animation have numbers after them 

//now to do a blood effect 
//

//GOAL FOR TODAY
///the dash effect. <=can be improve but for now it will do.
///the enemy animation dealing damage.
///a red effect when enemies are hit
//blood particles from being damaged, both player and enemy
//blood also land in the ground and the walls.
///ranged animation


//GOAL FOR TODAY
///enemies have weakness and strenght against the different elements: Physical, Magical, Plasma, Corrupt and True
///only the player has armor, which is a value that blocks everything. but the player suffer something unique for each damage
//then we improve the damage popup.
//take this moment to improve the damage code for enemy and player.
//i want the different damages be ligned.
///how damage scaling works
//the damage per bullet should work with events
//spawn some blood 
//player death animation
//enemy death animation


//the fade needs to move and be visible from all angles.
//i need to place fade in the player´s thing, but before removing the enemy from the game the fade ui needs to return to the right container.
//


//think the player not rotating correctly. especially when you aim  atht ehe nemy
//its working when aiming at the enemy, but now need to fix it being a bit wrong when not aiming at anything
//



//instead of just damage, we are going to have a 
//guns do not have just damage, they have a list of the damage tehy can do, such as magical or physical
//pen work by adding to any value that was lowered, up to the original amount 
//the player has a damage stat. damage increases all weapon damage. by a percent amount. every gun has a scale. only the first damage 

//DAMAGE POP UP I WANT TO GO UP AND THEN FALL TO THE LEFT AS IT FADES AND ALSO A SIMBOL BY ITS SIDE?



//what i want here?
//i would like the picture of the guy?
//i would like to be able to swap to talk with the people
//upgrade the storage where?
//all the sale is done as a conversation?
//i would like the picture by the side. maybe we could set as a picture instead of the actual model.
//or even chaging the camera to zoom in the npc´s face.


//you start the dialogue but at teh side tehre are three options, as it always has, Dialogue,check itens, and upgrade store.

//GOAL FOR TODAY
///create the damage ui
//the damage per bullet should work with events. damage per bullet type of thing.
///spawn some blood 
///enemy death animation
///to remove the enemy corpse we will play an effect
//deal with the animation for the city.


//GOAL
///a proper death ui
///player death animation
///when the player dies we zoom in the player.

//when you first open a tab the itens will reveal in order.


//GOAL
///there should be no gun ui if there is just a perma gun
///now having two guns is causing problem

///then a portal appears below the player and it goes down.
///create the animation and effects for the gun chest
//then the other chests <= test them more and complete the resource and ability.
///improve getting the new abilities UI and maybe the effects
///more sound effects for picking the ability.
///give a sound for the buttons, just the buttons for meantime. they all will have the same sound for hover and click <= test it
///you can see your abilities, and you can scrap those abilities and you can reroll, rerolling it increases the price for the next time. <= test it
//create a sound effect for scrap and for bless rolling



//maybe we can add a cool effect when we choose the card. like they all disappear. and the card you choose increases a bit and decreases.

//GOAL TOMORROW
///test the things from yestrday
///the cool effect for the ability ui.
//the ability ui to just improve it. make space for the improved ability. if there are no abilities it should be turned off. but it should always start from left to right.
//return to finish the teleporter. <= I SHOULD FOCUS IN FINISHING THE FIRST MAP
///if you cannot use the bless button it should show somehow.
///improve the resource gain pop up.



//GOAL TOMORROW
//put some effects in the portal. they create a sound when they open, but its local.
//revisit shrine system
//create challenges.
//make the aim better. it needs an offset. the aim is all crazy for some reason.
//change the fountain to be a shrine as well. but its a shrine that has an effect 
///make the system spawn the fountain. if there is no health fountain it must spawn a fountain health, if tehre is there is two health fountain it must spawna buff one.
//remember the audio for the fountain health and buff 
//you can only get one curse at a time
//you can only get three challenges at most.
//show those problems through fade ui.
//improve the quest interface
//when teh quest appear it informs what kind of challenge it is, the text fades and then the images moves away. maybe an animation that highlights the image as well
//





//so basically we will first have three different types 


//CHALLENGES
//i want things that may appear in the map or that appear after triggered.
//is having a shrine good?
//challenges also involve staying in one location for long enough
//shrines should be random and rare. 


//i will create one that you must stay in one position for the duration
//there will be a toten that will summon a miniboss and lock the doors. enemies outside should slowly appear inside? or not, or maybe we create a new wave for this room.
//i want shrines that give small temporary buffs - such as attack, health regen, and stuff like this
//i would like to still have these challenges. so we will create two shrines
//we will have two shrines, one with timer and the other that does not, but will have a penality. i need to inform the player of a penality
//the penality involves resources that you would lose resource, a portion of your resources per thing. cannot ahve more than one curse at a time.
//and curse will give perma buffs and bless.




//CREATING THE MAP
//terrain stuff
//light stuff
//the vision now disables thing that are too far for perfoamnce, and hides enemies.
//create that fog effect for the door, because i cant without the new graphic


//I WILL BE HAVING PERFOMANCE PROBLEMS IN THIS BUILD. for now we continue till we find actual perfomance problems.
//replace foreach -> for loops. they apparently run better
//some behavior i might use dots.
//create multiple canvas so they are not all rendering all the time.
//meshes seem to be much heavier. there must be a way to reduce their cost.






//those stats will all be show through a description window.
//ALL THINGS WE MUST SHOW INFO ABOUT
//abilities found, each stack and how much you used them, and how much damage you delat with them
//same thing for temp gun.
//same thing for the drops
//same thing for the resources.
//generic info: like total damage, money spent and money gained.
//i need to show story quests.
//i need to show equipped gun
//equipped abilities
//equipped trinkets.
//shrine challenges


//for the temp:
//gun
//ability
//general info
//resource
//challenges



//


//THINGS TO CHANGE
///the enemy must rotate to always face the player
//the animation must dictate when the attack deals damage and when the zombie can continue walking
