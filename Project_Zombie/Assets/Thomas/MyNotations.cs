//FOR TOMORROW
//passives stack properly when they are different levels. the basci will be influenced but the 3 stack is always the same.
//improve the passive algorithm :
//cannot give the player a passive that the player can no longer stack
//should prio a passive that the player has. increase it by 40% chance
///create lab
///create smith

//GOAL
///shoot a fireaball at mouse
///instantly reload the mag and deasl damage around based in the magsize.
///for a short duration all your weapons shoot twice as many bullets.

//GOAL
//pasive algorithm needs to take in mind the following:
//cannot give the player a passive that the player can no longer stack
//should prio a passive that the player has. increase it by 40% chance
//Passive Every hit applies bleeding
//Passive slow enemies by 1% per stack in shoot. at 4 has a chance to stun
//passive idle regen
//passive reload speed
//passive skillcooldown
//passive increase maxhealth. at 5 get a shield that is based off maxhealth.
//create shield mechanic.
//passive if the player has this item then he will revive once dead. but only once. cannot stack.
//passive deals 20% damage to bosses . at 3 deals 15% more damage to enemies with 80% health <= UNSURE
//passive enemies that have a debuff receive 3% more damage. at 5 they explode when killed.
//passive killing an enemy grants you 1 additional health. up to 100 per stack, can stack 5 times.
//heal one by every enemy you damage. the value increase one by every stack. up to 5.
//Does nothing till stack 3 - enemies that you hit that are below 15% of health instantly die.
//passive enemies around you are randomly struck by lioghting. every stack grants an additional lighting and 1% to the damage. the damage is based off the player´s damage.
//passive dashing deal damage. every stack increases the damage. at stack 4 you get a an additioanl dash ammo.
//you are luckier with all chests.



//there should be more to do in the base 
//there should be quest and a story line.
//there is a bit of citry managing
//you can send people in missions. you can put people to work.
//but they require something. they require resources, and you can expand and build in new places build new stuff.


//the city data should tell what kind of ui it will open?
//we can put that ai apart from playercanvas because there is no need to carry that everywhere.
//also a singleton and its called baseCanvas.

//GOAL
//create base systems
//can visit lab where you can get active abilities
//can visit smith to get perma guns
//in the right side you can click and a window will appear where you can equip all that stuff
//can visit the launch pad where you start missions
//can visit the HQ where you can get the quests.
//
//


//NOW the goal is to create a playable enviroment. for this i require:

//THINGS TO NOTE
//not showing the price for the things you can buy

//the map is too small. it wont work in maps like this
//the round is going faster per thing now. should be slower per turn.
//its spawning too much? how to fix it
//the giants are not working. they are getting stuck in the walls?
//The hound should be way faster.
//enemies are getting strong too fast.
//bullets are not being destroy by wall.
//the aim should be more free. it should only attack if you hover an enemy. or maybe we should have a false arm but the bullet should go to the object.


//maybe round should be slow. it always charge at the same time. the difference is that killing advances it further.

//MY GOAL
//the player is falling through the floor.
///show the price of itens when buying in the store
//fix the round. make it progress normally. 
//rework the spawner. something that feels more right.

///giant raidus effect is not working.
///the cap is not working


//ABOUT SPAWNER


//THINGS TO PUT IN THE ROOM
//there is a place to tune your temp weapon but its locked behind a requirement.
//there is a place that always hold the same resource depending on the stage.
//place for the stage quests like: survive in teh area for a timer
//random traps.
//boss arena where you can do some additional challenges. there is a cost behind as well.
//there should be secrets around the map. likes gates that can only be opened with things.
//the pause is triggered by the player.
//there are shrines that you need to do something to get them. they give you random possibilities.
//like destroy all current enemies, next turn will be a pause turn. the prayer it requires a test of honor, which would be the challenge.
//

//SPAWN BEHAVIOR
//at the start should go a bit faster. 
//it should spike way faster.
//need a way to force the player into leaving the first area.
//


//how to imrpove spawn system?
//


//ENEMIES
//simple - just walk forward.
//bomber - explode
//Hound - goes fast.
//Giant - slow walk and force the player away
//
//


//MYGOAl TOMORROW

//there should be an introduction in the beggining to offset the nothing at the strat.
//more enemies but weaker enemies
//there should be something to force the player out of the inital room.
//i think the healthbar should not show;

//MY GOAL TOMORROW
//improve turret.


//MY GOAL TOMORROW
//finish the turret.
///fix the enemy not moving from spawn
//improve spawn system
//check ability and gun systems.



//SYSTEM
//every passsive has a type out of three. getting 3 of one type allows gives you a slot to get another buff.

//GOAL
//create save system
//create main menu. you can have multiple save slots.



//WHAT TO ADD IN THIS VERSION?
//shield enemy that only takes damage behind. or if you have enough penetration
//enemies that are ranged and they shoot at you, so the player can never just stand still. 
//enemies that sit still, but if you damage them they will go after them.



//how else the player evolves?
//increasing raw stats.
//increase ability slots from 1 - 3
//powerful new active new abilities - 
//powerful perma guns - 
//trinkets - which will grant additional passives.
//New enemies and challenges.




//GAMEPLAY IDEAS
//enemies that take damage from just a place. like only in the back.
//certain rules are applied at certain times. like all chesta have bombs for a periord; 
//quests - your mission and you gain a bonus for it.
//challenges - do something really hard to get a reward.
//things you can do in the stage.
//you can improve your perma weapon by going to the forge and using a resource.
//you can mine for extremely rare minerals that are used in the base.
//you can do a secondary quest for a stage currency.
//they are random: stay in the circle for long enough, kill a quantity in a short duration, do a simple puzzle, deliver a heavy object to another place. 

//WHAT I CAN DO NOW?
//there will be places to mine resources. Iron and copper.
//there is a computer that you can gain intel, which allows to build new builds or, when activated oyu must protect the place to gain the intel.
//gun boxes
//there are shrines randomly placed in the map. you must complete a random goal to get the bless from this thing. "kill 100 enemies". you gain a bless. 
//A - forces a random bless. you must complete it or you lose 15% of your health. it gives 10 bleses. low timer
//B - choose one goal out of three. you must complete it or you lose 50% of your health. it gives 10 blesses. high timer
//C - force random goal. does not need to be completed.
//bless is a stage coin that you can use for other stuff. but for what? rerolls, open doors, summon bosses,
//create the upgrade box?
//you can unluck passages and teleports.
//there are powers that will appear from dead enemies? what and where?
//secret doors that require conditions. - 



//in the end of the game you can trade blesses for other things.
//but you can also trade for other things. blesses grant you rerolls.


//MY GOAL FOR NEXT WEEK
//Shrines and stage goals. create the three types of goals. can fit three goals at once.
//can use bless to reroll.
//can only open the doors to the boss arena from teh center not the sides. once the center is open can open the sides.
//can fall. have to make the ground collider a bit more forgiving.
//can use a bridge that works for a short duration
//blueprint computer where you must activate them and protect the area. once you do that you gain intel. (dont need to worry about the resource for the meantime)
//can use the shrine for some kind of power. it will consume the shrine and cost bless.
//create the upgrade system for temp guns.
//create teh artilery enemy. it will spawn at a random position. it argets the player aywhere. can only spawn in opehnj area. create sound for the player to find it.
//create ranged. it will just shoot projectiles. slwo projectiles.
//create mage that will damage teh area. but it moves.
//probably i will have to revise the spawn system
//take a time to get things clean
//check active abilities.
//create 3 more passives

//THREE MORE PASSIVES
//increase luck. at 3 gain money after every chest is opened. 
//if you die you are revived. you can only get one of this. it should be extremely rare for this fella.
//gain 25% movespeed when below 25% health. cannot stack.


//MY GOAL - 1
///3 more passives 
///create luck
///luck needs to do something, it needs to increase the chance of getting items.
///luck actually increases all chance based stats. increase critchance and dodge chance.
///create revive
///create movespeed when low in health
///can fall and die. more ground collider more forgiving.
///can use bless to reroll. 
///be able to create conditions to be able to open a door.
///create ranged enemy
///also - certain passives should be available at all tiers.
///also - cannot dodge certain damages.
///also - for some reason the stats from the data are not being passed to the enemy.


//MY GOAL - 1.5
///i want to change the round system to actually be per round. it will make easier to control
///but make it so you can swtich between the two easily.
//also - when enemies are killed the damagepopup goes down.

//MY GOAL - 2
//create the shrine system
//they spawn in map
//create the different types of shrine
//create the system for the goal
//can fit three goal at the same time.
//create the blueprint computer.
//quests can also be seen in the pause ui

//MY GOAL - 3
