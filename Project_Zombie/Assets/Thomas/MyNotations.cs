///then i will do the equip with no other gun
///then we will make that your guns can appear by the left.
///you can hover them to see their stats in relation to the chosen. when you no longer hovering it instantly goes back to only the chosen
//if you have two guns you need to select one for replacement. then we need to actually replace them and simply throg away the replaced gun.
///the rotations of new guns seem to not be working.

//you cannot get an ability that you are already stacked.

//FOR TOMORROW
//passives stack properly when they are different levels. the basci will be influenced but the 3 stack is always the same.
//improve the passive algorithm :
//cannot give the player a passive that the player can no longer stack
//should prio a passive that the player has. increase it by 40% chance
///create lab
///create smith

//GOAL
///shoot a fireaball at mouse
///instantly reload the mag and deasl damage around based in the magsize.
///for a short duration all your weapons shoot twice as many bullets.

//GOAL
//pasive algorithm needs to take in mind the following:
//cannot give the player a passive that the player can no longer stack
//should prio a passive that the player has. increase it by 40% chance
//Passive Every hit applies bleeding
//Passive slow enemies by 1% per stack in shoot. at 4 has a chance to stun
//passive idle regen
//passive reload speed
//passive skillcooldown
//passive increase maxhealth. at 5 get a shield that is based off maxhealth.
//create shield mechanic.
//passive if the player has this item then he will revive once dead. but only once. cannot stack.
//passive deals 20% damage to bosses . at 3 deals 15% more damage to enemies with 80% health <= UNSURE
//passive enemies that have a debuff receive 3% more damage. at 5 they explode when killed.
//passive killing an enemy grants you 1 additional health. up to 100 per stack, can stack 5 times.
//heal one by every enemy you damage. the value increase one by every stack. up to 5.
//Does nothing till stack 3 - enemies that you hit that are below 15% of health instantly die.
//passive enemies around you are randomly struck by lioghting. every stack grants an additional lighting and 1% to the damage. the damage is based off the player´s damage.
//passive dashing deal damage. every stack increases the damage. at stack 4 you get a an additioanl dash ammo.
//you are luckier with all chests.



//there should be more to do in the base 
//there should be quest and a story line.
//there is a bit of citry managing
//you can send people in missions. you can put people to work.
//but they require something. they require resources, and you can expand and build in new places build new stuff.


//the city data should tell what kind of ui it will open?
//we can put that ai apart from playercanvas because there is no need to carry that everywhere.
//also a singleton and its called baseCanvas.

//GOAL
//create base systems
//can visit lab where you can get active abilities
//can visit smith to get perma guns
//in the right side you can click and a window will appear where you can equip all that stuff
//can visit the launch pad where you start missions
//can visit the HQ where you can get the quests.
//
//


//NOW the goal is to create a playable enviroment. for this i require:
//a draft of base upgrade minigame: ability roll ; gun roll ; active abilities ; main guns ; improve stats(something different here)
//active ability: tier1 - 3; tier2 - 3)
//passive ability: tier1 - 6 ; tier 2 - 6
//main gun: tier 1 - 3; tier 2 - 2
//temp gun: tier 1 - 6; tier 2 - 3
//fix the gun popup. its not appearing really well and it should show really well.

//HOW BASE BUILDING WORK
//you can walk around. you can test abilities.
//you cant shoot guns in the base.

///become invisible
///become immune to damage for a short duration
//shoot a fireaball at mouse
