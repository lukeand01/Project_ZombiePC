///the player has stats
///the enemy has stats that can be scaled.
///first i needd to be able to change stats in a non-heavy manner
//i need to make every gun_Perma, _enemy and etc assign to the right event. and remove said events if they are killed.

///i need to randomly select 
//it shows the stats of that gun_Perma.
//we can reroll
//if we already have two guns then we need to select which one we will be replacing.

///cannot click till the thing is done spinning.
///now i want to do the reroll
///then i will do the equip with no other gun
///then we will make that your guns can appear by the left.
///you can hover them to see their stats in relation to the chosen. when you no longer hovering it instantly goes back to only the chosen
//if you have two guns you need to select one for replacement. then we need to actually replace them and simply throg away the replaced gun_Perma.
///the rotations of new guns seem to not be working.
///the chest gun is not swaping the right weapon


//when you receive a gun_Perma. it pauses the game and shows the the gun_Perma. you can roll again for the double of points.

//you cannot get an ability that you are already stacked.

//FOR TOMORROW
//passives stack properly when they are different levels. the basci will be influenced but the 3 stack is always the same.
//improve the passive algorithm :
//cannot give the player a passive that the player can no longer stack
//should prio a passive that the player has. increase it by 40% chance
///create lab
///create smith

//GOAL
///shoot a fireaball at mouse
///instantly reload the mag and deasl damage around based in the magsize.
///for a short duration all your weapons shoot twice as many bullets.

//GOAL
//pasive algorithm needs to take in mind the following:
//cannot give the player a passive that the player can no longer stack
//should prio a passive that the player has. increase it by 40% chance
//Passive Every hit applies bleeding
//Passive slow enemies by 1% per stack in shoot. at 4 has a chance to stun
//passive idle regen
//passive reload speed
//passive skillcooldown
//passive increase maxhealth. at 5 get a shield that is based off maxhealth.
//create shield mechanic.
//passive if the player has this item then he will revive once dead. but only once. cannot stack.
//passive deals 20% damage to bosses . at 3 deals 15% more damage to enemies with 80% health <= UNSURE
//passive enemies that have a debuff receive 3% more damage. at 5 they explode when killed.
//passive killing an _enemy grants you 1 additional health. up to 100 per stack, can stack 5 times.
//heal one by every _enemy you damage. the value_Level increase one by every stack. up to 5.
//Does nothing till stack 3 - enemies that you hit that are below 15% of health instantly die.
//passive enemies around you are randomly struck by lioghting. every stack grants an additional lighting and 1% to the damage. the damage is based off the player´s damage.
//passive dashing deal damage. every stack increases the damage. at stack 4 you get a an additioanl dash ammo.
//you are luckier with all chests.



//there should be more to do in the base 
//there should be quest and a story line.
//there is a bit of citry managing
//you can send people in missions. you can put people to work.
//but they require something. they require resources, and you can expand and build in new places build new stuff.


//the city data should tell what kind of ui it will open?
//we can put that ai apart from playercanvas because there is no need to carry that everywhere.
//also a singleton and its called baseCanvas.

//GOAL
//create base systems
//can visit lab where you can get active abilities
//can visit smith to get perma guns
//in the right side you can click and a window will appear where you can equip all that stuff
//can visit the launch pad where you start missions
//can visit the HQ where you can get the quests.
//
//


//NOW the goal is to create a playable enviroment. for this i require:
//a draft of base upgrade minigame: ability roll ; gun_Perma roll ; active abilities ; main guns ; improve stats(something different here)
//active ability: tier1 - 3; tier2 - 3)
//passive ability: tier1 - 6 ; tier 2 - 6
//main gun_Perma: tier 1 - 3; tier 2 - 2

//

//THINGS TO NOTE
//not showing the price for the things you can buy

//the spawn is too slow.
//the map is too small. it wont work in maps like this
//the round is going faster per thing now. should be slower per turn.
//its spawning too much? how to fix it
//the giants are not working. they are getting stuck in the walls?
//The hound should be way faster.
//enemies are getting strong too fast.
//bullets are not being destroy by wall.
//the aim should be more free. it should only attack if you hover an _enemy. or maybe we should have a false arm but the bullet should go to the object.


//maybe round should be slow. it always charge at the same time. the difference is that killing advances it further.

//MY GOAL
//the player is falling through the floor.
///show the price of itens when buying in the store
//fix the round. make it progress normally. 
//rework the spawner. something that feels more right.
///create a limit for enemies in the stage.

//


///Giant is doing nothing. he starts stunned.
///giant raidus effect is not working.
///the cap is not working


//ABOUT SPAWNER


//THINGS TO PUT IN THE ROOM
//there is a place to tune your temp weapon but its locked behind a requirement.
//there is a place that always hold the same resource depending on the stage.
//place for the stage quests like: survive in teh area for a timer
//random traps.
//boss arena where you can do some additional challenges. there is a cost behind as well.
//there should be secrets around the map. likes gates that can only be opened with things.
//the pause is triggered by the player.
//there are shrines that you need to do something to get them. they give you random possibilities.
//like destroy all current enemies, next turn will be a pause turn. the prayer it requires a test of honor, which would be the challenge.
//

//SPAWN BEHAVIOR
//at the start should go a bit faster. 
//it should spike way faster.
//need a way to force the player into leaving the first area.
//


//how to imrpove spawn system?
//


//ENEMIES
//simple - just walk forward.
//bomber - explode
//Hound - goes fast.
//Giant - slow walk and force the player away
//
//


//MYGOAl TOMORROW
//create console command system? need to be the type of system that i can easily comppletely removed from the game
//can spawn _enemy.
//can kill all enemies
//can get a passive with _id
//can get gun_Perma with _id

//NOTES FROM GAMEPLAY
//should deal more damage to enemies at the start. 
//the first area should definelty be bigger.
//there should be an introduction in the beggining to offset the nothing at the strat.
//more enemies but weaker enemies
//there should be something to force the player out of the inital room.
//i think the healthbar should not show;

//MY GOAL TOMORROW
//improve turret.


//MY GOAL TOMORROW
//finish the turret.
///fix the enemy not moving from spawn
//improve spawn system
//check ability and gun_Perma systems.



//SYSTEM
//every passsive has a type out of three. getting 3 of one type allows gives you a slot to get another buff.

//GOAL
//create save system
//create main menu. you can have multiple save slots.



//WHAT TO ADD IN THIS VERSION?
//shield _enemy that only takes damage behind. or if you have enough penetration
//enemies that are ranged and they shoot at you, so the player can never just stand still. 
//enemies that sit still, but if you damage them they will go after them.



//how else the player evolves?
//increasing raw stats.
//increase ability slots from 1 - 3
//powerful new active new abilities - 
//powerful perma guns - 
//trinkets - which will grant additional passives.
//New enemies and challenges.




//GAMEPLAY IDEAS
//enemies that take damage from just a place. like only in the back.
//certain rules are applied at certain times. like all chesta have bombs for a periord; 
//quests - your mission and you gain a bonus for it.
//challenges - do something really hard to get a reward.
//things you can do in the stage.
//you can improve your perma weapon by going to the forge and using a resource.
//you can mine for extremely rare minerals that are used in the base.
//you can do a secondary quest for a stage currency.
//they are random: stay in the circle for long enough, kill a quantity in a short duration, do a simple puzzle, deliver a heavy object to another place. 

//WHAT I CAN DO NOW?
//there will be places to mine resources. Iron and copper.
//there is a computer that you can gain intel, which allows to build new builds or, when activated oyu must protect the place to gain the intel.
//gun_Perma boxes
//there are shrines randomly placed in the map. you must complete a random goal to get the bless from this thing. "kill 100 enemies". you gain a bless. 
//A - forces a random bless. you must complete it or you lose 15% of your health. it gives 10 bleses. low timer
//B - choose one goal out of three. you must complete it or you lose 50% of your health. it gives 10 blesses. high timer
//C - force random goal. does not need to be completed.
//bless is a stage coin that you can use for other stuff. but for what? rerolls, open doors, summon bosses,
//create the upgrade box?
//you can unluck passages and teleports.
//there are powers that will appear from dead enemies? what and where?
//secret doors that require conditions. - 



//in the end of the game you can trade blesses for other things.
//but you can also trade for other things. blesses grant you rerolls.


//MY GOAL FOR NEXT WEEK
//Shrines and stage goals. create the three types of goals. can fit three goals at once.
//can use bless to reroll.
//can only open the doors to the boss arena from teh center not the sides. once the center is open can open the sides.
//can fall. have to make the ground collider a bit more forgiving.
//can use a bridge that works for a short duration
//blueprint computer where you must activate them and protect the area. once you do that you gain intel. (dont need to worry about the resource for the meantime)
//can use the shrine for some kind of power. it will consume the shrine and cost bless.
//create the upgrade system for temp guns.
//create teh artilery _enemy. it will spawn at a random position. it argets the player aywhere. can only spawn in opehnj area. create sound for the player to find it.
//create ranged. it will just shoot projectiles. slwo projectiles.
//create mage that will damage teh area. but it moves.
//probably i will have to revise the spawn system
//take a time to get things clean
//check active abilities.
//create 3 more passives

//THREE MORE PASSIVES
//increase luck. at 3 gain money after every chest is opened. 
//if you die you are revived. you can only get one of this. it should be extremely rare for this fella.
//gain 25% movespeed when below 25% health. cannot stack.


//MY GOAL - 1


//MY GOAL - 1.5
//also - when enemies are killed the damagepopup goes down.

//MY GOAL - 2
//create the blueprint computer.
//quests can also be seen in the pause ui

//create muzzle flash
//create an effect gfor the bullets so they look better.


//NOW THE GOAL IS TO PLAY THE GAME AND FIX THE WORSE PROBLEMS.
//we should start from the main menu
//we should play in the builded version.




//MY GOAL
//mouse ui is not turning red when hovering _enemy
///mouse ui is not showing when you open and pause and close
///mouse ui should have other shapes in main menu, city and pause
///spawning behind the portal. whatever rotation is not working.
///the shrine is not fetching quests
///the timer for shirne spawn should be bigger.
///the quest window is not opening when receiving a new quest
///the quest window is overlaying the pause ui.
///you can go through a gate with dash.
///the gun unit has a delay when getttgin description
///the round take too long to start
///the bullets should be faster
///the enemies need bigger colliders.
///there should be more enemies per wave
///the cooldown for the portal individual spawn should be lower.
//for some reason there are more people in the spawn list than are being spawned.


//MY GOAL
//i want _enemy to shoot faster on sight but less faster in next shot
///the enemy projectile is hitting own enemies.
//i want more enemies in the third round.
//when going right there is an inivislb ecollider.
//remove the invisible wall by the right. otherwise player cannot shoot through it
//i want the enemies attack to be two hitter to 3 hitters. (ranged will be a 2 hitters and melee will be a 3 hitter
//cannot go through the right door. 
//too easy to fall in the top
//i need to put more places for shrines.
//


///check if shrine is spawning
///check if gunupgrade station is spawned.
///check if gunbox is spawning

///the gate is not opening
///the left last gate is not passable
///the ui for the gunbox is wrong. the container not working
///when you get a new weapon fromt the gunbox its not appearing in the gun slots.
///i think the bullets should not have shadow because the shadows seem like the bullets
///very common getting stuck in different grounds.
//the enemies are too slow perphaps or they getting easily stuck because they are taking too long to go after the player. perphaps the solution would be to respawn some of them if they are too far for too long.
//too many enemies in the second wave. or they are too tanky. 
///so in the builded version adding a gun is not updating the ui
///also i cannot see the description window for the gun unit
///the box didnt destroyed once the ability was chosen
//the slow bullet is not working and breaking the gun_Perma
///the ranged are shooting too fast.
///


//the problem is the end ui. when i create a new fella for the endui i should not set it for the class.
//FIXE GOALS
///certain abilities are just not being added and not show in the thing. what abilities are not being added?
///the slow bullet are breaking the bullet behavior. slow bullet should show as bd
///the new portals are not being used to spawn the fellas.
///the revive passive is not working
///when you restart the mission is keeps all the stuff in it.
//the ability where you gain crit chance is breaking. but only in builded version.
///ranged projectile is passing above the player.
///getting stuck in gate.
///revive is always appearing. it should be extremely rare.
///even if the player already have revive its still appearing.

//DESIGN GOALS
///bleed deals little damage. it should just deal more damage.
//


//now i just need to make sure the abilities are working. so all weapons will be available to get as you wish.

//MY GOAL
//when i leave the screen i lose the block


//PROBLEMS WITH BUILDED VERSION
///for some reason the camera is not rotating
//teh canvas is all fucked
///the resource ui is not working
///the stat in pause ui is not working
//the store ui
//the dash ui
//the gun_Perma owned ui
///the character is not interacting
//the add items appear in the main menu
///ui for the abilities are not appearing
///cannot dash
///cannot open the equi tab
///the guns and abilities available are not appearing in the equip tab.
//one of the ability store items is not working

//the city has no block
///the gun in equip window not updating
///the ability in equip window not updating


//how to get the thing to work? the unit is not working in teh continar


//WITH THIS THE VERSION 0.4 IS COMPLETED

//CRITICS FOR VERSION 0.4
//

//VERSION 0.5

//MECHANICS
//the gun_Perma box is changed to look more like cod
//create the drop system
//you can build new buildings for your city.
//there are npcs walking around. they do nothing but they have to pretend to work
//create pop resource for city.
//there is an area where you can train and test your guns and skills
//there is a building that you can perma increase your stats.

//CONTENT
//2 new enemies
//3 new guns
//3 new gun_Perma upgrades
//3 new quests
//5 new passive abilities
//the turret active ability.

//PERFOMANCE
//pooling for projectiles
//pooling for enemies

//IMPROVEMENTS
//create main menu that lookas better
//create settings menu
//create effeect for the bullet

//GENERAL FIXES
//when you increase the total_Damage health you should health by that same amount
//the giant is walking sideways towards the player. remember to fix that when you put the grqpahics
//the pause ui passive abiity number is not showing the number of stacks
//the ranged enemies are not moving, and other times they are stuck near a wall firing at the wall.
//the guns are all called shotugn

//MY GOAL FOR THE AFTER THIS
//work in the city
//work in the main menu. add the settings
//create the drop system.
//create the pooling system which will improve the perfoamnce for projectiles
//create pooling for enemies as well.
//need to work in the buy store item screen.
//fix that the equip window will show the last position of the drag item for a splitsecond.
//create more passive abilities
//create more active abilities
//more gun_Perma upgrades
//more enemies
//more guns
//more quests
//add effects to the bullets
//when you pick the resource box it should stack the different resource being granted if they are the same.
//i think the ranged units should try moving after every hit. especially if the player gets too close.
//the gun_Perma box shouldnt be a ui. it should be like cod, a weapon rising to the air as the game continues to play.


//now i have to do it for ability
//what else do i want to do?
//i need to make sure its working in the equip tab.
//and now we will improve the buy screen.
//i want an effect for buying, not instantly
//i need to add more stats to the gun_Perma stats description.

//HEREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE

//TODAY
///button that resets to default.
///i will just fixc the thing fading when its not supposed to fade.
//then i will do the thing where armory can see the guns that i can get from chest
//and lab can see the passives abilities as well.


//


//things i need to make sure. that the passive is working
//that the guns can be found.


//i want to spawn the npc
//and i want to receive the quest.
//i need more stuff for the equip tab. i need a place to check the quests. i should be able to check quests in the main building as well.
//i want to see quests
//i want to see drops
//and eventually i want to see trikents. additional things
//also i need to create a way to increase stats.
//i also need to find a way to add these fellas to the list.
//where would you find npcs: quests and secrets.
//

//TODAY
///i want to create teh additional holders for the equip tab. "Quest" and "Drop" and "trinket" but i will do nothing in them yet.
///now i want to spawn the especial npc <- DO THIS YOU FUCK.
//find a way to change the dialogue and progress it
///then we add a quest
///add those quests to the equip tab
///add those quests to the main building.


//GOAL
//able to progress dialogue
///fix for the especial npc number appearing when its not meant to
///all the gun units are show as hidden. only the temp ones should be at default.
//try to gain a weapon and see what happens. a perma and a temp.
//then i want to create the 5the cod box <= half created. have to test in game.
///then i need to check the ability side.

///now i have to test receiving a perma and a temp weapon
///then i go and do the same to abilities. 
///then i need to create the logic for passive ability spawning.


//now i need to create the thing for the drop system
//first we create the data to hold it all
//second we create the store where you can buy stuff
//then we create the equip tab

//now i will check if the perma stats are passing to the game
//i will create the perfoamcen stuff. pooling for projectiles and enemies.
//then we will fix the stuff


//i need to improve the movement. should move towards the mouse. take it from stone shard
//the abilities are black


//projectile pooling and _enemy pooling
//that means that when i want to instantiate something i should use a reference instead. i need to get every place that ever shot a bullet




//most of it should be working

//should i just directly put it in the player instead of doing this?

//PROBLEMS TO FIX 
///i am need to update the units to show if they are maxlevel.
///also change speed so that its a bigger number.

//then i need to do the dialogue progress.
//then i head to the drop and the the stage part of the game
//also create the thing for increasing stat.
//whern i get here the goal is to first fix the bugs.
//then i will create stuff for perfoamnce. pooling


//the goal now is improving movement
//need to change teh cooldown for the dash. teh cooldown will go less far and will have a much higher cooldown.
//


//the dialogue i will skip for now. too stuck on it.
//lets just create the thing for improving stats
//then we will take a look at teh drop. at buying, getting, assign them onequip tab and increase 

//PROBLEMS
///the buttons from the holder are duplicating
///the units are not updating. thats because its only getting the actual list and once i change the currentBulletIndex list i am not updating the actual list.
///the problem the guns are not appearing in the equip tab
///for some reason the owned gun list is duplicating one item three times.


//i want to create the drop system.
//at least for now i will do the space in teh equip tab.
//then i will create the city data for it.
//i want to have a quest for expanding the drop system from 1 to 3.


//TOMORROW
//take a better look at movement and dash
///fix the ability getting dark
//fix the logerrors that were showing
//test some more the change to pooling
///fix the collider in the spawner
//stage quest not resetting <- have to test
//fix the dash passing through the door.
///equip tab is over the pause menu
//the suicide bomber deals damage to everyone. also the suicide bomber is immortal.

//MY REPORT
//what i need to do now to improve this game?
//i need to create teh respawning for the enemies.
//i need to make it challenging for the player. the player cant just peacefully stroll around the game
//i need to create ways to get the store contacts
//and i need to create story quests. so i need to create a screen for when you return from the city.
//i need more enemies. and i need them to be more vicious.
//i need the _enemy projectiles be faster, but there is less of them
//i need an _enemy that jumps at the player. need to keep player always guessing. i want the player to always keep moving.
//i need to create 
//need to make sure the abilities are fun. especially their interactions.
//create a melee system. perphaps incentivizing melee will do wonder for the game. to spare ammo and do some cool attacks
//i need to increase the speed of every _enemy at later stages but to a cap.
//make a way so they cant dash through the gaps to areas where they havent opened it yet.




//perphaps the fireball should charge and leave the player stuck. unless they move which stops the charge.
//we can create enemies that keep damage the sourroudnings. if it gets close enough it will deal damage by ticks.


//THE GOAL IS TOO SIMPLY MAKE THE BASE GAME FUN. EVEN WITHOUT POWERS. THEN I WANT THE POWER TO IMPROVE TEH GAMEPLAY
//i want to achieve this through: movement, melee, enemies behavior.
//i want to be the kind of game that you are cobnstnatly in the edge.
//the way to achieve this:
//the player has to behave in ways to get what they want. melee for conversing ammo and more points. certain enemies have weak spots. 
//certains enemies spawn in different places so the player has to keep an eye.
//currently the base _enemy offer no danger. too slow. increase speed, reduce attack. if they are near you they should deal damage.
//then the map will be another thing because the player will need to do things aruond the map. every map will have a gimmick.
//the game never lets the player just rest. 

//need a way core to the game how to restore ammo.
//ammo will be restored through random boxes. touching it grants you a portion of your ammo back.
//

//need a way to force the player out of one room. and that will be through the spawns. there will be way more spawns.
//ammo is gained by getting dropped ammo box. but if they are rare enough wahts the point of the melee?
//but when should we stagger?
//dodge also deals damage and stuns those hit. maybe this could be an ability.
//i will not be using the melee. because it doesnt fit with the style? but perphaps certain temp guns are melee.
//i need the mage to be more interesting. 
//you have weaker mage. is the same but it also fires the projectile.
//and the strong mage. is the same but the projectile is stronger and faster. and the artillery creates many 
//a shield _enemy. it bounches everything you shoot slowly but its very slow to rotate.
//
//


//GOAL FOR IMPROVING GAMEPLAY
//reduce even more the dash.
//increase speed and attack speed for basic enemies.
//increase projectile speed.
//more enemies: Mage, Assassin, Shield and a charger.
//i need enemies to despawn and spawn close to the player. and to do we check the farthest enemies from the player and do that.
//created ammo box that recover a percent of the ammo of all weapons.
//create the different turn systems.
//create effect for the bullets.
//create a system where i can charge an ability
//create the drop system? think about this


//i will first get the system working in

//GOAL FOR NOW
//i will crewate teh drop system. the enemies shouls still drop ammo and abilities with the same chance <- TEST
//create ammo box. it replenishes a percent value. <- TEST
///create bullet effect
//fix the problem with the fellas spawning
//then i want to improving the spawning system, so they spawn only close. maybe some fellas only want to spawn behind the player.
//and also they should despawn to never be too far.
//i want the ability box, ammo box and drop box to be constantly rotating. <- TEST

//also need a way to war what the player has picked. and maybe a ui from the box could appear that stands still for a while.
//also let me start working in the spawn system.


//GOAL FOR TOMORROW
///test the ammobox
///first let create the city and the building that controls the drops
//teste teh drop spawn system <= check further later on other testing
///then i want to check if the especial conditions are working
///create an ui when you pickj a drop

//GOAL
//improve spawn
//each stage should have its own difficulty.
///there should be a list of closests gates and another in between. we spawn most in the closests.
///if the enemy is too far and out of sight then he will despawn and respawn closer to the player
///certain enemies are immune to this respawning. such as artillery - Giant is not.
//also the abilities shoukldnt apear if they are not being used. also should set the level for player about the ability.
//



//RULES FOR SPAWN SYSTEM
//we need a liskt of closests rooms. a gamehandler checks who is certain level for hr first and another for the seocnd. most are spawned in the first.
//we reform the list with period of 5. so it doesnt overrum too much.
//we check the enemies as well. if the enemies are ever too far away, and also not visible in the camera then we remove it and put it in the list to replaced again.
//but there should be exceptions, such as artillery. it doesnt care how far it is.
//create a way to tell in which room the player is.


//the drops i will create
//nuke all creatures low level
//Double points for a period
//next gunbox for free
//Health regen
//

//GOAL FOR TOMORROW
//


//turn types:
//Normal
//Madness: all doors close at random times and they stay closed for short durations. enemies outside just wait.
//Nightmare :enemies deal more damage and move faster.
// 

//DROP TYPES:
//Nuke all small enemies.
//



//Melee mechanic
//create a melee attack.
//it works as following: has ammo that can be restored, does damage but doesnt stagger, if the _enemy already is staggered then it pushed them back and dealms more damage.
//you can deflect projectiles

//REPORTS AFTER PLAYING
//also the pop resource in the bar the text is wrong
//the stage canvas still has the button holder.
//the enemies are spawning regardless of the rules
// 


//GOALS _+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_+_

//i want a _enemy that jumps
//i want a hive _enemy. _enemy that spawns others.
//i want a better mage.
//i want an _enemy that causes areas to be not accessible for a short duration.
//

//currently we have:
//simple - which will be the masses.
//ranged - which throw simple projectiles
//bomber - explodes. deals a lot of damage but should be easy to deal with.
//Hound - fast _enemy with low health.
//Giant - offers crowd control against the player. big and tanky.
//Mage - hard to deal with as they keep creating many speels to kill you. i want different mages.
//Artillery - Create a reason for the player to keep moving


//what i want
//Shielded: it doesnt take damagage from the front so it will charge at the player. charge simply means that it moves fast for a moment but also is that it doesnt turn very well.
//Jumper: it jumps at teh player. it jumps at the player cause damage but stun for a short duration
//trapper: it hides in a spot. if the player passes gets damaged and stunned
//

//the shielded _enemy cannot be just tanking stuff.
//


//for some reason the shield is taking damage.
//what we can do is that the charge stops if the player is ahead, and then push the player backwards.
//problem is that i am not using physics. 
//so when i amshooting too close then it will simply stop the bulklet.
//i will use a raycast. it will check if its its wall. if its a shield and if its close enough then 

//i might change how the shield works to isntead be the enemybehavior. it will check the damage direction instead of the driection,.
//charge behavior does the push


//first thign i will change the enemyto actually check if it has a shield. this will prevent the problems. more as a safenet to be safe.
//second thing will be doing the charge.

//the little weird steps the charger takes.
//


//we will focus in the next step before charger just to ge4t me some time.

//GOAL STEPS
//get the shield _enemy working well. <= it needs improvement but i will go to something else now.
///improve the mage: it will spam a bunch of attacks.
///a big eye that looks at the player. causing burning damage while the eye has line of sight.

//the charge is still doing that weird movement


//GOAL STEPS
//overhaul the control of spawn intensity throught the stage data.
//create a system where you can change the kinda of round. control spawn and stats and everything.
//when you reach 25 turns, the next rounds will use another system. instead they will be constantly spawning and consta increasing.
//need to create a cap of enemies so it doesnt spawn more. i should pu the cap at 150?



///first i will create the eye
///need to create a fakelist for the round
///need to pass the new graphic for the round ui
///need to create a list for spawns. and decided the chances for spawning from the especial list.
///Tthen we test the effect of bloodmoon
///i want to stress test the spawn cap. 

//we are having problem with with spawning. fix it. why is it spawning 6 and hwy is it not passing to the portals.
//

//PROBLEMS
//first the the value is not spawning correctly.
//second its not feeling good for some reason.
//why the thing is spawning.;
//sometimes the bullets are stuck in the air, waiting for - if the bullet is not moving then we destroy it.
//the cap for _enemy spawn is not working?
//also cant spawn giant? problem with pooling


//Passive ideas:
//killing an _enemy has a chance of converting that _enemy as an ally
//Summon an ally after every ability use.
//damage bd can crit.
//can fly for certain durations.
//when enemies are killed they explode.
//increase damage percent.
//increase damage flat.

//create a stat called leadership that influences any allies damage and health.

//TEMP GUN IDEA
//Laser gun_Perma. once you shoot it charges and fire a beam that last a few seconds.
//Laser rifle. it charges and shoot a nomral bullet.
//Sword. swip in front
//


//GOAL STEPS
//then i will create two new passives (Thunder, )
//then i will create the turret
///then i will create a new enemy ()
//the reload ability was not working
//you could dash through walls
//decided what to do with the gaps
//and fix the player falling and dying.
//create an effect for the portal spawning _enemy.

//foir now the perfomance seems alright. i need to focus in the other parts till i get in troulb ewith it

///fix reloadability. create a pop up when you use this ability.
///create an effect for the portal spawning.
//Laser gun_Perma and laser rifle
///can dash through walls and gates?
//can stand in the gaps outside of the map
///test the mage offset.
///should not be able to dash if you are already over teh wall.

//i will test the charge tomorrow.

//what am i going to do with these gaps? i want them for gameplay


//GOAL STEPS
///i want the ability to fly as well.
///also the button for return no longer working
///make falling a bit better. instead of idrect death, you see the character falling and the camera moves.
///can raise and lower barrier allowign for you to dash through it. those barrier will be opened by opening the right gates.
///check for abilities resetting on death
//check to reset quests on death
//check for stucks
///the dash ui shows the direction of the dash and if its facing a wall it shows a x


//GOAL STEPS
//create 2 new guns (laser, )
//create 2 new gun_Perma passives
///create another enemy
///create 2 more shrine quests.

//GOAL STEPS
///create the system for creating zombies through dead enemies.
//create the turret system. 
///create ui for allies. show their decay.
///creaste teh system where enemies are able to target allies
//make leadership stat influence them
///suddenly cannot reload weapons anymore
//there should be a limit to how many converted you can have?
///not only the player can trigger 

//GOAL STEPS


//also need more variable to choosing target. 
//certain enemies wont target anyone but the target.
//you cant keep changing targets.


//need to do a bit of a rewriting for the _enemy targer dewtection
//make sure that it can deal with ally and players.

//so i want to change how they target

//GOAL
//add effect for explosions (mage, artillery, bomber, and fireball)
///also add shake effect from them as well.
///not show the flyholder if you dont have it.
//get different projectiles in the poolhandler. _enemy and fireball
///need to test if the cap is working for spawning
///also reduce the amount of roll reducec per failed spawn
///make so that a spawn with 0 chance cannot be spawned.
///camera shake is erupting the camera.

//GOAL
///fix the giant
//finish the turret
//for fireball projectil: make it so you can see it growing while you charge it, and also put it in the pool, also creat teh eexplosion
///create teh vsx for burning in enemies.
///the bd are not cleared from dead enemies.
///the game reloads with the weapons reloaded.
///the ranged enemy is stuck? no projectile. 
///fix the giant attack. its not being called.


//ranged is taking too long to shoot
//and took long to adjust position.

//GOAL
///for some reason i swapned the main gun for the temp gun
//turn on the drop system


//GOAL
//create the Beserker, that shows its attack with indicator and rapidly charges. on arrival it does something.
//shield charges, but sloy, but doesnt show


//now thgat i am back what was i doing?
//creat ethe shield _enemy and charge _enemy.
//turn on the drop system
///now the enemies are not being cleared after reseting the thing. i dont know why. but it should be an easy fix.
///try to spread the enemies a bit, just a bit. the rule is that you cannot choose the same in a row.
//i need to get the right number of points.

//i want the player to be able to open the gate first level.
//but i want to give an option between rushing and playing it safe. what can i spend money earlier on?
//but in the early game you can buy sentries, allies, you can buy certain boxes. or they come out of enemies free.
//
//spend money to regen health
//you can unluck places you can buy stuff, for your weapons of for abilities with points


//so the next part toi realse this version is to create the mechanics for points


//GOAL
///Sentry (i still need this)
///a little bot that flies aruond the player. cannot bet target, but shoots the zombies.
///create random boxes, random bots that cost money to be used
///can spend money to regen health, it is consumed and takes some time to regen
///create a way to go to a different place, which you will return in time.
///in this area you have a seller that sells you a abilities or weapons upgrades. they cost points and are extremely expensives.
///they can also sell Curses, which are powerful passives that also have drawbacks.
///create the enemy that has a shield, and biggest functions is to try and annoy you by blocking your hits.
//create teh charge _enemy, that i will jump at where the player is at and try to disrupt the player somehow.
///i need a system for spawning the random fountain, random guns, random sentries, random abilities
///the ability boxes need to be able to respawn, the sentries as well.
///fix the problem about the money not correctly updating.
//the weaponupgrade are also shown in the armory, and show what has been found and you can get more by upgrading armory. and from quests. 
///curses go in different lists, you cannot be offered the same curse. so we must be able to check for it.
///also the curses should go in a different box for the player to see.
//give some dialogue for the merchant
//activate drop system
///create pool system for turret flying





//THE LAST THING TO DO IT AFTER TESTING AND FIXES
//create testing tools
//can control spawn



//shield _enemy will be just a regular _enemy with a shield.
//the charge _enemy might spawn with shield and might now.
//i will focus in the charge.
//this guy will be a knight. he has a shield and he shows his charge, then he quickly charge.
//and the basic enemies might gain a shield as well, but they wont charge.


//problems
//i dont weird rotation for the thing. maybe its not world canvas.

//


//actually i need to create teleporter buit i also need one that has timer.]

//now i need to create the timer for teleport once triggered it will forcefully teleport the player
//
//and then i will create the seller



//what you must do to unluck the teleporter?
//it must be an achievemtn which the player must progress towards.
//

//it will be a random seller every time
//it can sell abilities, gun_Perma upgrades or curses.
//there will always be three options right in front of the merchant
//you can talk with the merchant as well
//each of the options are alwayws random



//the problem with the spaw. i should put a cap list somewhere else.
//need a way to spreadn better the fellas in the portal.

//TESTING REPORT #1
///simple melee was spawned but couldnt move
//hound did a weird thing going around the ability chest.
///not spawning everyone. not able to chec
///when you restart the weapon doesnt start reloaded (ammo)
///for some reason i swapned the main gun for the temp gun
///fix the gun stats. shootspeed, magazine and reload speed are the worse.
///the wallgap are connected to wrong doors.
//turn on the drop system
///not show the fly holder
//only the same abilities? is there a reason for it?
///bullet not flying from ranged enemmy. it got stuck
///the bd are not cleared from dead enemies.
///hound need to be much faster
///giant is stuck for some reaosn. giants are spamming audio sounds as well.
//still the problem that the round text is invisible somtimes
///should not spawn enemies that have a 0 zero chance to spawn
///mages should have bigger cooldowns between attacks. otherwise they just keep spawning, and the random should be a bit more
//the character should be slow at the start. 
//the shield enemies are just breaking, they should have more time between spot and charging. 
//the game is creating weird situations where one portal is taking too long to spawn everything it was given
//

//DESIGN SUGGESTION REPORT 1#
//create stage {} that create random bolders around
//the goal is to create stage minigames - such as bus, carts,
//next version create mini-bosses that follow the player. mini-bosses have several moves.
//create events that lock rooms
//create traps. area that require to wait for the right moment that have traps in the floor and stuff like that.
//spawning things cost a lot. need to create pooling for other things as well.
//what if you dont have dash at the start?
//should i use dots for certain things like bullets? the perfomance is lowering too much


//TESTING REPORT #2
//for some reason when the ranger shoot that bullet gets thrown to the bullet pool. solution is to fix the bullet pool problem.
//

//DESIGN SUGGESTION REPORT 2#
//normal ranged bullet are a bit bigger and slower.
//


//TESTING REPORT #3
///Fix the player shooting enemy projectiles <= 
///find a way to warn the player has been shot <= 
//the fly turret is not targetting the simple _enemy 1
///sometimes the roudn text is invisible. <= 
///respawning after too far from the player is causing problems. this is causing to break the rounds because the enemies are not respawning <=
//maybe shift the camera to see below better.  <= 
//the fly ui should be invisible if the player does not have fly <= 
//ability chests and turrets are destroying themselvs.
//fix the drop; dropping it too much
///chest ammo is not interact and it should be trigger. it should float above the ground and rotate <=
//do the same thing for the power. differ the two some way.
///assign the canvas for the chest ability <=
//the dog has too little rotation <= 
///the round text is insta. should not be
///shield not working
//the damage flash is getting stuck. <=
///the dog pathfind is weird. it shouod turn much faster.

//TESTING REPORT 4#
//i think the damage ui should be a bit higher
//the _enemy projectile stopped? why?
///i want the shield attack to still throw the player
///the shield enemy is throwing the player but it should not yet
//the _enemy mage stopped attacking? i think its because i destroyed an _enemy for some reason. 
///the damage flash. maybe the mage caused it? nope. 
//the _enemy projectile should haev shadow to help dodging it.
///the round text is turning invisible once again.
///the round is not passing? at least not showing that its passing.


///yellow chest disappear in the second buy. instant without giving the weapon. maybe it didnt reset right
///the chest crashed hte game. why are they exploding? the turret should shoot faster but last little.
//shift the camera better? the player being attacked from outside vision from basic ranged is not ideal.
///double points is not working. use the double point event.
///flying is being enabled at random points



//have to start checking the interactions between city and stage
//check if itens beinn found are appearing as found.
//

//the mage is not working and i suspect it has something to do with reusing the same mage.

//the chances to spawn the ability box are not good. too low. there should be more of them. 
//also there should be more random boxes around


///i need to do something about the shield rotation.
//

//i have to not use courotine for those two things
//

//Fix some things
///the drop launcher is duplicating its stuff
///it is not showing the pop in the resource tab
///not updating pop resource 
///remove the fucking dash sound
///make sure that the weapon you start with is added to your library.
///we are allowed to buy a gun that we already have. should show what guns you already have. 
//same things for the ability.
///change the name of the store ui.
//buy the ability but it doesnt appear in the inventory.





//DESIGN SUGGESTION REPORT 3#
//the player should win points by passing a round as well?
//


//PASSIVE IDEAS
//Allies last 10% more and have 10% more health. every 3 levels increase the quantity of allies you can have by 1.
//Spawn a flaming torch that keep moving around you. each increases damage of the fireball. every 3 increase the quantity of fireballs by 1.
//


//ACTIVE IDEAS
//Spawn an ally. he has no limit duration.
//spawn a ranged ally.
//Blocks against ranged attacks.






//first goal is to actually create an ally that can be targetted by enemies.

//more shrine quests: 
//open doors
//find resource boxes
//find ability boxes
//crit x times
//kill 3 giants
//mine x resources
//spend x points

//GOAL STEPS
//create training area.
//improve the main menu
//change the ui


//GOAL STEPS
//take a look at map mechanics
//start testing the game heavily.

//GOAL STEPS
//then i need to create story quests
//and a way to get luck that is interesting
//a way to get main characters.
//and new dialogues and quests.


//MY GOAL
//create npc behavior. they will spawn depending on your base state and they will work depending on what yuour base has avaiable.
///you can build bases. expanding the pop increases the number of houses. 
//create the economy for the city building
///the player should see all the avaialab eresources in the top.
///space for the npcs to spawn randomly in certain houses. the houses they spawn into should be consistent.

//MY GOAL
///Drop system created

//MY GOAL
//create an area where you can train in the city. when you leave the area you are locked but when you enter it you are allowed to use skills.
//create 3 new passives
//fix the turret

//MY GOAL
//improve the main menu
///create the settings menu

//MY GOAL
///change the gunbox to work like zombie cod
//create 2 new guns
//create 2 new gun_Perma upgrades

//MY GOAL
///you can improve your perma stats.
///it uses an extremely unique resources.
///create 2 new enemies
//create 3 new quests

//MY GOAL
///create system for pooling projetiles <- TEST MORE
///create system for pooling enemies <- TEST MORE
///create effect for the bullet

//GOAL
//fix the problems

//GOAL
///change how guns and abilities work <- FUrther testing

//GOAL
///create npc you can talk. they spawn in an empty house. empty house being a house that wasnt occupied by another especial npc. the houes occupied needs to be far enough from another occupied house
///you can talk with those npcs from teh main base as well.
//

//GOAL
//create dev tools for testers.
//can contorl what can spawn, force spawn resource, gunchest, ability, forcespawn enemies, stop and set the round. 

//GOAL
//change the ui


//CITY
//how to make the city interesting?
//we have character just walking around and working
//you have to improve the city.
//the city has a pop, which you gain by completing quests.
//you need to build houses to actually gain pop
//and you need other things to build houses.
//improving buildings require pop as resource
//create a minigame for a turret defense?
//i want minigames in the city as well
//pop resources: population you gain by completing missions but there is a cap limited by the main building. 
//Pop, Food, Iron, Eletrical, Bless Stone, BodyEnhancer, Blueprints, 
//Food is consumed by pop. not having enough food means you lose pop.
//Iron is required for everything.
//stell is required for more advanced stuff.
//Blueprints are used for abilities and guns but they are rarer.
//Eletrical components are used for abilities and certain guns and drops. unlucking things for the player to use in the stage.
//Bless stone is used for sacred buildings. extremely rare.
//Body enhnacer is used for for increasing stats
//


//how the temp upgrade system works?
//you have to choose one of the weapons. 
//so you hold the weapon you wish to give. then you interact and you lose that weapon
//it takes a time and when complete it delivers the weapons back.
//but how the upgrade works?
//it improves all gun_Perma stats.
//some of these fellas can stack.
//stats - damage, reloadspeed, magsize, 
//and it gives one additional value_Level :
//Headshot - first shot against target deals more damage.
//Double mag - 50% of the magazine
//explosive ammo - bullet deal damage in area.
//more barrles - 2 more bullets per shot
//thick bullet - each bullet goes through one additional target.
//blood consumer - this weapons has 15% vampirism.
//Light weight - gives movespeed when holding this weapon.
//Fragmentation Bullet - every bullet in contact with an _enemy breaks off into three other pieces that deal 20% of the damage. they do apply status
//Possessed - start a quest that after completing it grants this gun_Perma higher damage.
//Sharp Projectile - grants this gun_Perma 25% pen.
//Reload Protector - when you reload this gun_Perma you recover 50 % of your shield. you get a shield of 50;
//




//MECHANICS - DROPS
//you will have abilities to set pre game
//you can choose cards, and those cards will spawn things in the game at every x turns.
//you start with the ammo one.
//

//upgrade system
//each gun_Perma must have ability passives.
//this wont be passive otherwise it will show in ui.
//so we create a "gunpassiveData" which it can hold and alter gunpassives.


//TO DO
//when you start the game all building are reset but for one, the main building
//in the top all resources will appear. the pop resource will appear differnetly showing how much it has and how much it is using
//when you interact with a building that hasnt been built it will show how much you require of pop.
//if you have enough you can built and the building will come from the ground
//you can upgrade the main building to increase the pop cap. you dont need to get the pop just the cap
//you can upgrade the buildings having enough resources.
//your base spawn npcs that walk around your base
//the npcs visit the places based in what buildings are working, they will sit in front and talking around.


//BUG FIND IN RODRIGO TEST
///tab equip window is above pause.
///reload instant not working ability
///the ability units are black for some reason. tehy cannot be seen.
//door in the left 
//when you respawn your current gun_Perma. what that means?
///suicide is moving and dealing global damage
//abilities 
///getting stuck in the wall. spawner has collider in show 
///going through wall. when dashing.
//quests are not reseting
//getting stuck
//should move towards where the mouse is.


//i need to change how weapons are found
//i probably dont want the same gun_Perma in different tiers.
//but i want guns to be improved. so perphaps i have two equal guns and the guy just replace the guns.
//the player should have a list that is defined by the tier list, so the same system, but we add a especial list of guns that the player get from quests.
//perpahps the tier system is not what i want. like what you should be able to do is instead have a quantity of guns and then you add the guns.
//abilitiies should also have a list for ownedabiilties that work in the same way as espeecial
//what about abilities?

//first i will check the mainbase. if its level 0 then i will reset the whole city. if not then i will update every fella based in their own level.
//


//where to put the especial npcs? 
//maybe they dont spawn in the map? they work as dialogue fellas that you can access in the mainbase
//but how to make the base more massive? i want the base to grow and become big.
//the way to do that is by adding a bunch of small houses to fit the pop isntead of just one. it will still be increased 
//where do i place the houses and the especific buildings? the main buildings are also quite close.
//the only reason you would explore the rest of the city is for minigames you can randomly find around the city.


//what do i want in teh dialogue? its supposed to be quite simple and easy the only things it will happen is dialogue then followed by accepting a quest.
//i want a quest system as well, but a quest system additional to the other quest system. this will be called story system
//
//
