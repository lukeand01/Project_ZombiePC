//MY NOTATIONS


//does this game need a server? it would require for the mobile version. 
//or we can just check by time. but what would create many problems



//IT needs to be easy to change from mobile to pc. my plan is to do both, at least partially, leaving place for 



//GOAL
///move system. the player can move and can look around
//gun system. can equip and shoot the weapons.
//interaction system. can interact with items and doors.


//need to make it shoot now.

//GOAL
///there is the one perma and two temps
///create ammo system. perma always has infiite ammo
///can reload. 
///can change the behavior of bullets. we carry the bullet behavior in the player because this will be universal now.


//GOAL 
//create stat handler for entity.

//GOAL
//create enemy behavior. 
//create pathfind
//take a look at destructable terrain
//create damage class
//create simple melee
//create simple ranged.
//create heavy
//create bomber.
//enemy can be shot and can be killed. show the damage pop
//enemy spawn from portals that can oepn in the world. but they also can be closed.


//GOAL
//create active ability system
//create passive ability system. the perma guns should also be capable of carrying abilities.
//create bd system.

//GOAL
//create map 
//portal spawn
//the three chest spawns
//different chest behavior
//put the round or timer system
//enemies start spawning
//you are given quests to complete for rewards
//you can extract to win resources.
//the game can be started


//problem! if you can extract that takes a bit of the sense of getting the temp guns
//actually extracting should be really hard.
//but what about the resources you got? you still get the resources. you can extract at certain places for a lower reward than continuining.
